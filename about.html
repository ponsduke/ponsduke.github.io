<h2>About</h2>

<p>
The Postdoctoral Organization for Neuroscientists (PONs) is devoted to addressing issues that affect postdocs in the Duke neuroscience community. PONs’s initiatives are aimed at strengthening connections among postdocs, helping new postdocs integrate into the community, and providing support for late-stage postdocs as they transition into academic and non-academic positions.
