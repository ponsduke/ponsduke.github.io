# **First Year Wrap**
As we close the chapter on our inaugural year, it's a great moment to reflect on our journey as a postdoctoral neuroscience organization. When we first launched, our goal was to foster collaboration, share knowledge, and create a supportive community for early-career researchers. Looking back, we’ve accomplished so much together.

From hosting engaging seminars featuring leading experts in the field to organizing K99 NIH workshops that honed our skills in grant writing, this year has been a whirlwind of learning and growth.

As we look ahead, we’re excited to expand our initiatives. Some of the plans for the upcoming year include developing a department-wide skills database and outreach events intended to foster a collaborative and supportive working environment.

Thank you to everyone who has been part of this journey. Your enthusiasm, dedication, and passion for neuroscience have been the driving forces behind our success. Here’s to another year of discovery and collaboration!
