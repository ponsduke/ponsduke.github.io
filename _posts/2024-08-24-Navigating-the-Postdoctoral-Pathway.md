# **Navigating the Postdoctoral Pathway**
 
This summer course, entirely led by Postdocs, was tailored to PhD students contemplating the pursuit of a postdoctoral fellowship, with an emphasis on shaping the postdoctoral experience to their individual goals. We helped equip these students with the tools to navigate the postdoctoral decision and journey successfully. Below are the six hands-on workshops sessions that we discussed.

| Session              | Topic                |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1 | **Deciding I:** Why do a postdoc?  Deciding whether a postdoc is right for you, and what you might get out of it for careers in industry, academic research, etc.|
| 2 | **Deciding II:** Where and how. Finding and creating postdoc opportunities that fit your needs and aspirations.|
| 3 | **Applying.** Deciding where and when to apply; reaching out to potential mentors.|
| 4 | **Interviewing and networking.** Getting comfortable speaking about your research; connecting with potential mentors informally.|
| 5 | **At your visit.** What to look for when you visit a lab; gathering information to help choose a position.|
| 6 | **Starting and planning your postdoc.** Transitioning from grad student to postdoc; shaping your position to your goals; communicating your goals with your mentors; looking for funding.|
