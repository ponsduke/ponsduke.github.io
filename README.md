# Duke Postdoctoral Organization for Neuroscientists

The Postdoctoral Organization for Neuroscientists (PONs) is devoted to addressing issues that affect postdocs in the Duke neuroscience community. PONsâ€™s initiatives are aimed at strengthening connections among postdocs, helping new postdocs integrate into the community, and providing support for late-stage postdocs as they transition into academic and non-academic positions.
