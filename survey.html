<h2 style="font-size:3em; font-weight: bold">Skills Database</h2>

<p style=" font-size:1.5em">
PONs is surveying postdocs in the Duke neuroscience community and is building a 
searchable table that lists each postdocâ€™s technical skills and the software platforms 
with which they are familiar. Our goal is to build a tool that will help postdocs find 
local experts in techniques that they hope to implement in their own projects. 
You can now access this database <a href="https://publish.acho.io/6bf3904a-af71-44f9-88b0-593f6932bb84/home"> here</a>
